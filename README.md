## About my Project

For this project I used starter code to build a workout tracker. The tracker allows the user to view, create and track their daily workouts. They can add exercises to compile their workout. Exercises are either cardio or resistance and the user can add a variety of parameters - name, type, duration, distance, weight, sets and reps.
